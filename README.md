## Troubleshooting

**"No module named 'pgzero'"**
- Windows: `pip install pgzero`
- Mac/Linux: `pip3 install pgzero`

**"No module named 'level_data'"**
- Make sure `level_data.py` is in the same folder as `pgzgame.py`

**Missing images or sounds**
- Ensure `images/` and `sounds/` folders exist with all required files

**Mac: "command not found: pgzrun"**
- Use `python3 pgzgame.py` instead
